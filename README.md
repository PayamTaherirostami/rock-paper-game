# rock-papre-scissors

## This is my first game. I used JavaScript and HTML and CSS to build this game
## Functions that I used in this game are:
#
* Sort()
* random()
* querySelector()
* setAtribute()
* createElement()
* appendChild()
* addEventListener()
* setTimeOut()

# Let's play the game <a href="https://rock-paper-scissors-game-beta-sandy.vercel.app/"/>here!
